# Git Branches

## Features

Provide a more convenient view of branch operations.
This plugin defines a command `git-branches.all-branches` that can be used to list all branches in the repository, and then several most useful operation on them.

## Usage

You can use it by typing `git-branches.all-branches` or `All Branches` in the command line.
Or you can bind it to a keyboard shortcut, which I suggest.

## License

Feel free to do anything with this plugin.
Glad it helps.

**Enjoy!**
